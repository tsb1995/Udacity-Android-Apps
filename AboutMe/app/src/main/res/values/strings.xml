    <string name="bio">Hey all, this is TayMath!\n\n

	\t\t\tHere to go through math and test prep. Bios are important because they represent things about our character. They include our interests and hobbies as well as a history of relevant Information. Without them we would know much less about our fellow humans.\n
	\t\t\tPersonally, I enjoy learning new things, practicing Brazillian Jiu Jitsu and other combat sports, playing games, and making new projects. I studied a long time in mathematics and have been learning a lot more about programming and how computers work.\n
    \t\t\tAdding more information to properly fill the screen because we want to test this scroll view! Information includes SAT/ACT Prep, Kaggle Competitions, CS50 from harvard, Stanfords Machine Learning course, etc. Also tall, 6 foot 1, white, nerdy, very boring. Magic the gathering has a new RPG, need to look it over (probably not very good!)\n
    \t\t\tHope this was interesting!</string>
